AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting): For controlling access and tracking user activities.
Syslog: For logging network device activities and troubleshooting.
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): To automatically assign IP addresses within the network.
STP (Spanning Tree Protocol): To prevent network loops and ensure redundancy.
Inter-VLAN Routing: To enable communication between different VLANs in the network, ensuring efficient data flow and security.
